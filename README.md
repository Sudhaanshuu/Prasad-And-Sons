## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get Prasad-And-Sons up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Prasad-And-Sons/Prasad-And-Sons.git
    cd Prasad-And-Sons
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Supabase project credentials. You can find these in your Supabase project settings.

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```

    *Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your actual Supabase project details.*

4.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The application will now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

5.  **Build for Production**

    To create a production-ready build:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```

    The optimized build artifacts will be located in the `dist` directory.

### Supabase Client Usage

Here's a basic example of how the Supabase client might be used within a React component to fetch data:

```typescript
// src/components/ExampleComponent.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// Initialize Supabase client (ensure env variables are loaded)
const supabase = createClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<any[] | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      setLoading(true);
      const { data: fetchedData, error: fetchError } = await supabase
        .from('your_table_name') // Replace with your actual table name
        .select('*');

      if (fetchError) {
        setError(fetchError.message);
        setData(null);
      } else {
        setData(fetchedData);
        setError(null);
      }
      setLoading(false);
    }

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading data...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Data from Supabase:</h3>
      <ul>
        {data?.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{JSON.stringify(item)}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```
